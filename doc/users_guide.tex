\section{Installation}

Stile is a Python package that relies on the numerical package NumPy.  It is known to work for
Python v2.7 and NumPy v; it is designed to work for Python v2.6+ and NumPy vX but may not have been
tested on all possible configurations.  

\subsection{Dependencies}
Stile is designed to run what it can and ignore what it can't.  Therefore, there is very little
in the way of required dependencies: only Python v2.6+ and NumPy v+. We divide the following list 
into {\em recommended} dependencies, which are necessary for some (but not all) of the systematics
tests, and {\em optional} dependencies, which make the code work better or faster or more easily, but
which are not required for any test.

\subsubsection{Recommended dependencies}

\begin{itemize}
\item corr2 ().  Any test which relies on a correlation function calls this program.
\item GalSim ().  Any test which requires moments measured on images will use GalSim (unless the 
moments are given as precomputed entries in a catalog).
\item astropy or pyfits.  Required to read FITS tables or images.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Optional dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
\item pyyaml.  Makes configuration file writing much easier.
\end{itemize}

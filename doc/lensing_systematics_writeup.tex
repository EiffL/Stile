\section{Tests based on lensing signals}

\subsection{Tangential and cross shear around objects}

Lensing is sourced by gravitational fields, which cannot source a curl.  Therefore, the cross shear components,
\begin{equation}
g_x = \Im(\mathbf{g}\exp{2i\theta}),
\end{equation}
should always be consistent with 0.  The tangential shears should be $>0$ near the object if the 
objects are real.

\subsection{Tangential and cross shear around random points}

As the cross shear around objects should be 0, so should the signal around random points.

\section{Tests based on position and shape correlations}

\subsection{Cross-correlations of stars and galaxies}

Stars and galaxies should be uncorrelated. However, in the presence of incorrect background subtraction, incorrect PSF estimation, and other systematics related to the detection and correct modeling of stars, the detection efficiency for galaxies may be altered close to bright stars.  To investigate this, we compute

Before making a PR:
 - Run all the tests in the tests/ directory and make sure they run
 - Run all the example scripts in the examples/ directory and make sure they run
 - Update any documentation and run `make clean html` to regenerate the docs
 - Check for line length and whitespace errors (eg with pep8ify)
 - Add an update to the CHANGELOG.md in the main directory
 - Check that you've merged the most recent version of master
